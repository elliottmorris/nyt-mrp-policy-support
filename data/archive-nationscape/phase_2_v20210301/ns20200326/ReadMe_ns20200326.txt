- Changed text of question stem for primary_party to say “Will you OR DID YOU vote in the Democratic or Republican primary in your state in 2020?
- Added a rep_vote_past question
- If respondent says that they will/did vote in the Democratic Primary/Caucus in their state or are “not sure”, they also answer dem_vote_past 
- If respondent says that they did vote in the Republican Primary/Caucus in their state or are not sure, they also answer rep_vote_past
